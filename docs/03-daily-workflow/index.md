## While Working on the Project

Follow these steps when working on a professional Python project.

1. [Git pull](01-git-pull-before-changes.md)
2. [Run and check](02-run-and-check.md)
3. [Build and serve documentation](03-build-serve-docs.md)
4. [Git add-commit-push](04-git-add-commit-push.md)
5. [Update project files](05-update-project-files.md)


## Important

- Always pull the latest changes before starting to avoid merge conflicts.
- Test your project before each `git add-commit-push`.
- Make frequent commits when enhancing a project.
