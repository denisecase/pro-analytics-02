# 🔵 Git Add, Commit, and Push to GitHub

> How to save progress

## 1. Git add-commit-push

Use a terminal in VS Code (PowerShell, zsh, or bash).

IMPORTANT:
Replace the commit message with a clear and descriptive note about what you added or changed.
Wrap the commit message in double quotes.


```shell
git add -A
git commit -m "update file"
git push -u origin main
```

After subsequent changes, you can shorten the last command to:

```shell
git push
```
