## Writing Good README.md Files

Every GitHub project has a README.md file with an overview.
The file type is `Markdown` and it's a very simple Markup language for text.

- A Markdown `title` starts with: hash space
- A Markdown `second-level heading` starts with: hash hash space
- A Markdown `un-ordered list` starts with: dash space
- A Markdown `ordered list` start with: 1. space
- Markdown `code fencing` uses three **back tics** on their own line to display code and commands.
- Markdown **bold text** is surrounded by: two asterisks
- Markdown *underline text* is surrounded by: one asterisk


Markdown skills are critical for project README files,
Jupyter Notebooks (code, charts, and narrative together),
and writing technical papers with Sphinx.
