## Important

- These setup tasks are critical.
- Verify each step works before proceeding.
- Follow the steps carefully and in order.
- For projects that use templates or examples, review the project first and understand the starting structure.

## Pronounce Key Files and Folders Correctly

- When you see `.gitignore`, say "Dot Git Ignore" file.
- When you see `.venv`, say "Dot V E N V" folder.
- When you see `README.md`, say "READ ME Dot M D" file.
