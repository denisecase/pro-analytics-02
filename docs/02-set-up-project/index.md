# 🟠 Workflow 2: Set Up Project (Once per Project)

This section provides step-by-step instructions to initialize a new Python project.
These tasks include starting a project from scratch or using an existing template, setting up the project files, and creating a project environment for development.

**IMPORTANT**: Complete all of Workflow 1 first.

## Steps

1. [Start in GitHub to Get a New Repository](01-start-in-github.md)
2. [Enable GitHub Pages](02-enable-github-pages.md)
3. [Clone the Repository To Your Machine](03-clone-repo-to-local.md)
4. [Open the Project in VS Code (and Install Recommended VS Code Extensions)](04-install-vscode-extensions.md)
5. [Set up Project Python Environment (managed by uv)](05-set-up-virtual-environment.md)

## Important

- These setup tasks are critical.
- Verify each step works before proceeding.
- Follow the steps carefully and in order.
- For projects that use templates or examples, review the project first and understand the starting structure.

## Pronounce Key Files and Folders Correctly

- When you see `.gitignore`, say "Dot Git Ignore" file.
- When you see `.venv`, say "Dot V E N V" folder.
- When you see `README.md`, say "READ ME Dot M D" file.
