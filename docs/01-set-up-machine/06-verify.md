# 🟢 Verify Workflow 01: Set Up Machine

> This page verifies that your **Machine** is correctly set up for professional Python projects.

---

## 1. Use Machine Terminal to Run Commands

On your machine:

1. Open a **machine terminal**.
2. Navigate to your `Repos` folder.
3. Paste one command at a time into the terminal and hit ENTER after each:

```bash
git --version
uv --version
code --version
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
```

If versions or git config commands do NOT work correctly, re-do the associated installation and configuration steps above.
Work with an AI assistant (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude.ai, or other) to resolve any issues.

## Final Checklist

When all of these are true, your setup is complete:

- [ ] You can see hidden files and folders.
- [ ] You can see file extensions.
- [ ] All three version commands respond with version numbers.
- [ ] Your Git configuration information is correct.

Congratulations - your machine is ready for Python projects!
